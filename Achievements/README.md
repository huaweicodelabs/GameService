## Introduction
The sample code integrates the achievements feature of Game Service to provide a sample program for your reference and use.


You can use HMS Toolkit to quickly run the sample code. HMS Toolkit supports one-stop kit integration, and provides functions such as free app debugging on remote real devices. For details about HMS Toolkit, please refer to the [HMS Toolkit documentation](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/Tools-Guides/getting-started-0000001077381096).


## Environment Requirements
